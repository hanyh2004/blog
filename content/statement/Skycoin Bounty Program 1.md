## Translations

Translate posts from this blog.

Accepted languages are:

* Deutsche
* Español
* 日本語
* 한국어
* Ελληνικά
* Français

*Note: 中文 and Рyсский translations all have someone working on them now*

We may add more languages later but aren't able to verify translations for other languages yet.

Every 500 words is 5 SKY. For example:

* 1-500 words: 5 SKY
* 501-1000 words: 10 SKY
* 1001-1500 words: 15 SKY
* ...and so on...

At the bottom of each English-language blog post, the reward for that article is shown.

The post must not already be translated.

If a post is already translated but you find mistakes or improvement, we can give a small reward as appropriate.

One or two other native speakers of the translated language must review the translation to check its quality.
Bad translations will not receive a bounty, although you are free to improve it until it is accepted.

## Writing

Blog posts, articles

* Negotiable based on views, publishing outlet, quality.
* Contact us ahead of time until we establish a way to value written content.

Please be sincere with content produced for the bounty program.
If something appears to be done in bad faith we may reject or reduce the reward (for example, fake youtube views or sloppy infographics).
